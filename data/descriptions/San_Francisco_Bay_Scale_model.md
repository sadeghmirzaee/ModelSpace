## Overview

It is the paradigm case of concrete models.

The **San Francisco Bay Model** is a **massive hydraulic scale model of the Bay and Delta systems, built in the 1950s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It was used to simulate tidal flows and study the prospects of building it.

Located in **Sausalito, California**, the model covers over **1.5 acres** and replicates the bay and surrounding waterways at a **1:100 horizontal scale** and **1:10 vertical scale**.

## Key Features

- Physical simulation of tides and water flow
- Used in research until the 2000s
- Now a public visitor center and educational exhibit
- Built **before computer simulation was practical**

## Engineering Insight

The model helped assess the environmental impact of large-scale proposals, including:

- **Reclaiming parts of the Bay** for development
- **Water diversion plans** to Southern California
- Understanding **sediment transport**, **salinity**, and **tidal effects**

## Fun Fact

> It takes **4 minutes** in the model to represent **1 full tidal day** in the real world!
