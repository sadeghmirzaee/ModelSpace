## Overview

The **Schelling Model of Segregation** is a computational model introduced by economist Thomas Schelling in the 1970s. It represents how **individual preferences**, even if mild and tolerant, can unintentionally lead to **large-scale patterns of social segregation**.

The model simulates a hypothetical neighborhood as a **2D checkerboard**, with agents of two types (e.g., red and blue) scattered across cells. Agents move if the fraction of their neighbors that are "like them" falls below a certain threshold.

## Philosophical Significance

In your thesis, the Schelling model is identified as the **paradigmatic case of a computational model**, exemplifying algorithmic structure, procedural update, and **emergent behavior**:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

- The model is implemented as an **automaton**, operating via discrete steps and local interactions.
- It demonstrates how **macro-level social patterns** can arise from **micro-level decisions** without any central coordination.
- It’s also notable for being **non-mathematical in formulation**, despite being rule-based and deterministic.

## Fuzzy Model Membership

| Model Dimension          | Degree |
|--------------------------|--------|
| Concrete Model           | 0.1    |
| Mathematical Model       | 0.1    |
| Computational Model  | 1.0 |

As shown in Table 3.3 of the thesis, this model scores high in the **computational** dimension, and low in others. It is a clear case of what your thesis calls **“algorithmic modeling”**, which contrasts with continuous mathematical modeling like the Lotka-Volterra equations:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Interpretive Insight

> “Even mild preferences for similarity can yield extreme social separation.”

This model is a powerful **epistemic tool**: it doesn’t predict specific social outcomes, but shows how seemingly benign conditions can produce unexpected collective phenomena.

The model is especially useful for philosophical reflection on:
- **Emergence** and **nonlinear dynamics**
- The limitations of **aggregative reasoning**
- The value of **simulation as insight**, not just prediction
