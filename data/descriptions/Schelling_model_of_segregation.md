## Overview

The **Schelling Model of Segregation** is a computational model introduced by Thomas Schelling in the 1970s. It represents how **individual preferences**, even if mild and tolerant, can unintentionally lead to **large-scale patterns of social segregation**.

The model simulates a hypothetical neighborhood as a **2D checkerboard**, with agents of two types (e.g., red and blue) scattered across cells. Agents move if the fraction of their neighbors that are "like them" falls below a certain threshold.

## Philosophical Significance

The Schelling model is chosen here as the **paradigmatic case of a computational model**, exemplifying algorithmic structure, procedural update, and **emergent behavior**. It demonstrates how macro-level social patterns can arise from micro-level decisions without any central coordination. It is non-mathematical and unpredictable, despite being rule-based and deterministic.  This is a defining feature of computational models (**automaton**) in contrast to mathematical ones.

Other major cellular automata are Conway's Game of Life, and Wolfram's one-dimensional automaton.
